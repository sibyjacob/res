            <p> This project was the result of the evolution of the hispeed.rogers.com which required a more feature-rich CMS to keep up with a sharp
              increase in user page view and web traffic numbers.</p>

            <p> The Channel Lineup Information and Capacity Calculator was built in order to centralize data that was being stored in a series of disparate
              Excel files. This data was imported into a database and a web application was built to more effectively manage it. Functionality was also
              added to calculate how much bandwidth was still available in different cable systems.</p>

                support for the change, resistance was felt from the end users who were reluctant to move from the current system. After
                demonstrating, through prototypes, that existing functionality would be preserved and the new functionality that would be added,
                the users were more receptive and participatory in the build process</li>
              <li class="icon-circle-arrow-right">System was built using JSPs and Java servlets including data exporting functionality to Excel and PDF using Java POI library</li>
